# Pte Panel Discord Bot #

this is a little discord bot I made that interacts with your pydactyl panel via discord!

## things to do: ##
* Add a permissions system (maybe with discord roles) so not everyone can do everything (only administrators can change the api tho).
* Add more admin settings like making a server. I'll need to set up a local pte panel, so I can test this.
* Learn how to do webhook and websocket things so you can see console because you can't at the moment. (I do not know how these work)

## Python packages needed: ##
* py-cord
* py-dactyl
* adiooop-lts (only if python version is 3.13)
